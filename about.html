            <h2>Our goals</h2>
            <p>
              We are a free and accessible website that offers a plethora of
              recipes to choose from. The inspiration of our website was to
              create a site that is easy to orient onself about its functions
              for ease of usage by all.
            </p>
            <h2>Initial intentions</h2>
            <p>
              Our goal was to offer diversity in one's nutrition no matter the
              individual. As we all know, finding recipes online can be a
              challenge for some, the endless amount of websites offering
              recipes either too complicated or not accommodated to ones dietary
              restrictions.

            <h2>Ambitions</h2>
            <p>

              always on the lookout for ways to better the accesibility of this
              website and offer if you don't want to miss out on these new
